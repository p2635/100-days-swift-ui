# Goals

- Learn enough to support iOS test automation work.
- Learn to follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) while writing code.
- Build a basic iOS dev portfolio, the proof is in the pudding!
- Document my progress (see logged issues in this repo)

# What's in the course?

**Days 1-14: Introduction to Swift**

The first 14 days provide a gentle warm up for your SwiftUI learning as we cover the fundamentals of the Swift programming language. You’ll work through a selection of tutorials every day, and there is some optional extra reading afterwards if you’d like to dig deeper.

- Day 1 – variables, constants, strings, and numbers
- Day 2 – Booleans, string interpolation, and checkpoint 1
- Day 3 – Arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums
- Day 4 – type annotations and checkpoint 2
- Day 5 – if, switch, and the ternary operator
- Day 6 – loops, summary, and checkpoint 3
- Day 7 – functions, parameters, and return values
- Day 8 – default values, throwing functions, and checkpoint 4
- Day 9 – closures, passing functions into functions, and checkpoint 5
- Day 10 – structs, computed properties, and property observers
- Day 11 – access control, static properties and methods, and checkpoint 6
- Day 12 – classes, inheritance, and checkpoint 7
- Day 13 – protocols, extensions, and checkpoint 8
- Day 14 – optionals, nil coalescing, and checkpoint 9

Note: I did not take notes on all 14 days, but I did go through it. I promise!
