# Time Conversion App - Day 17 Challenge ([external link](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19))

In the WeSplit app project, I followed videos to code the project so that was easy. This time converter app was more fun, because I had to use more brainpower to code from scratch.

## The requirements

- User selects an input unit and an output unit.
- User chooses seconds, minutes, hours, or days.
- User enters a value.
- User sees the converted value.
