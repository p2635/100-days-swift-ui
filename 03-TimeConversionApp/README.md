# Time Conversion App - Day 17 Challenge ([external link](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19))

For the WeSplit app project, I followed the videos to code the project. For this one, I have to use more brainpower because it's coded from scratch.

## The requirements

- User selects an input unit and an output unit.
- User chooses seconds, minutes, hours, or days.
- User enters a value.
- User sees the converted value.
